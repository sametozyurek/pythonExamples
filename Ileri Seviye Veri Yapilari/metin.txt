She was always called the bad girl, for she had once, when she was very little, put out her tongue at the postman. She lived alone with her grandmother and her three brothers in the cottage beyond the field, and the girls in the village took no notice of her. The bad girl did not mind this, for she was always thinking of the cuckoo clock. The clock stood in one corner of the cottage, and every hour a door opened at the top of its face, and a little cuckoo came out and called its name just the same number of times that the clock ought to have struck, and called it so loudly and in so much haste that the clock was afraid to strike at all. The bad girl was always wondering whether it was worse for the clock to have a cupboard in its forehead, and a bird that was always hopping in and out, or for the poor cuckoo to spend so much time in a dark little prison. If it could only get away to the woods, she said to herself,  who knows but its voice might grow sweet, and even life itself might come to it!
Give me one, she said; perhaps the cuckoo would like it. But they all cried, No, no! and tried to frighten her away. They are for the little one’s birthday. To-morrow she will be seven years old, they said, and she is to have a crown of flowers and a cake, and all the afternoon we shall play merry games with her.
